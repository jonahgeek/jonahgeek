## But who is Jonathan? 🤨

\
Jonathan Mwebaze is a human being, bug 🐛 slayer, UI/UX & javascript ninja who's extremely interested in bringing people's dreams into realities by using his extraordinary abilities of Code & Design. He also loves to share with other developers on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tsxjonah) & through [writing some posts](https://www.getrevue.co/app/issues).

In his day job, Jonah codes MERN & PERN stack apps because that's literally all he's good at when it comes to code and also does some bit of graphics design. 

You can find me on the internet 😉;
